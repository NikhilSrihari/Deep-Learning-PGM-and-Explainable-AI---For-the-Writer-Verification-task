# Deep Learning, PGM and Explainable AI - For the Writer Verification task

The purpose of this project is to document the output and analysis of Writer verification with 4 different AI models: Bayesian Model, Siamese Network, Autoencoder network and Multitask Trainable Encoder Network on 3 different data sets. <br/> 
Our primary task , i.e., the Writer Verification task is simple - Given 2 images, determine if they are from the same writer or from different writers. <br/>
- Data Set : We use the 15FeatureDataset from CEDAR Buffalo site. This is divided into 3 datasets: "seen", "unseen" and "shuffled" 
- The complete dataset is not made available as part of this repo. It needs to be downloaded into the "15FeatureDataset" folder from the CEDAR buffalo site<br/><br/>
1. Task 2 involves creating and training a Bayesian network for each of the 3 data sets and noting down the different metrics. 
2. Task 3 involves creating and training Deep Learning models for each of the 3 data sets and noting down the different metrics. 
3. Task 4 consists of the same task as Task 2, but with ‘and’ dataset. Finally, Task 4 involves creating and training Explainable AI models for each of the 3 data sets and noting down the different metrics. <br><br>

The report details the individual tasks and lists out the results and metrics.
